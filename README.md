# Rane-One-MKII-with-Algoriddim-djay

Midi Map Includes:
- Removed looper - Mapped an additional Sample bank to Sample double press and added samples to it 
- Remapped Stems pads button to correct order, so pads 1-4 to: Vocal, Melody, Bass, Drums
- Remapped Stems pads FX, pads 5-8 to: Echo out 1/2, Echo out 3/4, Juggler, Landing (FX are found in djay's software).
- Mapped Acapella stem button to FX 5. Duplicated the row in the midi map and routed to FX 5 (this FX is found in djay's software). Delete this line if processing is not preferred for the Acapella standalone stem. 
- Mapped beat jump to Parameter Left (16 beats backwards)and Parameter Right to (16 beats forwards)
- Mapped both key locks to “Add to queue” 

Note that Stems are processed through the djay, so uses the FX found in djay and has nothing to do with the HW/SW found in the mixer section of the board. Therefore, changes to 3 and 4 above must be done in the software. Image in zip.
